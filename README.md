# ATP-TENNIS-PREDICTOR
For Tennis Ace Project by CodeAcademy

The CSV file was provided by CodeAcademy. Provided in tennis_stats.csv is data from the menâ€™s professional tennis league, which is called the ATP 
(Association of Tennis Professionals). Data from the top 1500 ranked players in the ATP over the span of 2009 to 2017 are provided in file. The 
statistics recorded for each player in each year include service game (offensive) statistics, return game (defensive) statistics and outcomes. 

I used the scitkitlearn library with Python to train the dataset, provide regression modelling based on some features and outcomes which
I found interesting. 

The repo consists of the file analysing dataset, training models and graphing the result of such models. 

The sample results are included as png files.
